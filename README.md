# d2-resurrected-to-lod-txt-conversion
An attempt to write converters for some txt files, to mod some D2 Resurrected content into D2 LoD

# Getting started
- You need to own Diablo 2, Lord of Destruction, and Resurrected legitimately to be able to use this tooling, and you'll need them installed to get access to reference files.
- Install both a [Casc viewer](http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html) for extracting resurrected content, and an [MPQ viewer](http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html) for extracting D2 Classic/LoD content
- Follow the instructions to export the `global\excel`folders
- Install the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
