# How to use
- In your `Diablo II` installation folder add the directory `data\global\excel`. 
- Copy the text file(s) into this folder
- Start diablo 2 with the ` -direct -txt` arguments. Either with a shortcut where you add this text to the target (e.g. `"D:\Games\Standalone\Diablo II\Diablo II.exe"`), or by editing `Plugy.ini` to set the value `Param= -direct -txt` under the `[LAUNCHING]` section
- Start the game.

# Contents
- runes.txt, converted from retail d2r. For the people needing dirty hax, there's a runeword Armageddon, make from `ElEl` that is rediculously OP. This is added so that you can test that the runewords are taking effect, and you can use it if you just want easy mode. I created it for fun. 
- levels.txt, with area levels from d2r
